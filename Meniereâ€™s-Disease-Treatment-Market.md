Treatment options may become more patient-centric, focusing on both symptom management and long-term outcomes.</p><p>In terms of market value, the global demand for Meniere’s disease treatments is expected to increase significantly due to these innovations. The increase in global healthcare spending, along with the rising prevalence of Meniere’s disease in aging populations, will drive this growth.
